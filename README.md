# Codeforce Daily

Codeforce Daily is an application designed to help coding enthusiasts and competitive programmers stay consistent in their problem-solving practice. Inspired by the daily problem feature of platforms like LeetCode. The program selects an unique problem each day, based on the users rank. 

## Features

- **Daily Problem**: Receive a new problem every day, matched to your current Codeforces rank.
- **Streak Tracking**: Keep track of your consistency with a streak feature that logs your daily progress.
- **Rank-Based Problem Selection**: Problems are selected based on your rank, ensuring that they are appropriately challenging.
- **Runs locally**: To ensure that your data is not misused, everything runs and is stored locally, except for an API call to codeforces.com

## Getting Started

You can find the release folder under the 'Releases' tap on the Github homepage (https://github.com/AaronCodesPython/DailyCodeforce/releases/). From there just select which platform you want and download it.

### Windows:
After unzipping the 'Release' folder you download, the .exe can be found under /Release/CodeforceDaily.exe

#### MacOS:

After downloading the Release.zip, open it and locate the CodeforceDaily Application file, right click the program and then click open, otherwise the os will tell you that it could not scan the program. After doing this the first time, it will be safed as an exception and you can open it normally.

### Android:
 
 Connect your phone with your pc and enable USB-Debugging on your device. After that transfer the .apk file that you can download to your phone. Now you can open it on your phone and install the app.
