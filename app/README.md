# Codeforce Daily

Codeforce Daily is an application designed to help coding enthusiasts and competitive programmers stay consistent in their problem-solving practice. Inspired by the daily problem feature of platforms like LeetCode, Codeforce Daily offers a unique problem each day, tailored to the user's rank. This project is especially useful for those preparing for competitive programming contests or looking to enhance their algorithmic skills through regular practice.

## Features

- **Daily Problem**: Receive a new problem every day, matched to your current Codeforces rank.
- **Streak Tracking**: Keep track of your consistency with a streak feature that logs your daily progress.
- **Rank-Based Problem Selection**: Problems are selected based on your rank, ensuring that they are appropriately challenging.
- **Runs locally**: To ensure that your data is not misused, everything runs and is stored locally, except for an API call to codeforces.com
